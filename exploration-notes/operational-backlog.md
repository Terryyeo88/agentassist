# Operational backlog — deferred (as of 2026-06-01, post-T1.4)
Not development blockers. Action in a later session. Full detail in
AGENTASSIST_TECHNICAL_STATE.md Appendix C (item numbers below).

1. SAP CAL instance lifecycle (Appendix C #5, #17) — trial at 35.186.145.230 may have
   lapsed; confirm it is live; parameterise the IP fully into per-client config and remove
   hardcoded fallbacks; consider a snapshot/restore so re-deploy doesn't lose seed state.
2. Seed cleanup + re-baseline (Appendix C #8, #14) — 9 seed docs are live in SBODEMOSG and
   run_baseline_tests.py holds a placeholder instead of reference figures. Decide cleanup-or-not
   with Collin; script credit-note cleanup (cleanup_test_data.py only cancels invoice seeds);
   re-run the baseline; update the script comment block + Appendix B.
3. Fallback-credentials inconsistency (Appendix C #27) — verify SAPB1Client.__init__: if it
   falls back to demo creds when env vars are absent, change to fail-fast (RuntimeError) and
   reconcile the two contradicting doc sections.
